### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Emilio Ortiz
I'm a passionate frontend developer from Mexico. Since I was a kid I always liked to learn more and more about programming, things like languages, paradigms, technologies, and more. It's very exciting to learn new things. Currently I'm learning more in depth how to use Next.js. I really enjoy creating things, it is very rewarding to acquire the tools to create things that could be very useful for someone.
